### _"It is fortunate that the words chosen are so powerful, because otherwise there would be a risk of Breckenreid's illustrations stealing the show."_

--Vanessa Curtis, Review: A Room of Your Own. Virginia Woolf Bulletin, No. 74, the Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain.

My work has been twice selected for **The Original Art** exhibition at [the Society of Illustrators](https://societyillustrators.org/): first in 2021 for _Dorothy & Herbert_, then again in 2023 for _The Pocket Book_. This prestigious annual showcase and catalogue honors the year's best children's book illustrations published in the United States.

**Dorothy & Herbert** _"…memorable, innovative illustrations (including a particularly dramatic double gatefold) capture the Vogels' love of art and the artists of New York's SoHo community…"_ \- Kirkus Reviews _"What an odd and enchanting book! …"_ \- The School Library Journal

- A Gold Standard Selection from Junior Library Guild (JLG)
- The Canadian Children's Book Centre magazine, Best Books for Kids & Teens for 2022 gave Herbert & Dorothy a Red Star, signifying a title of exceptional calibre.
- The kitchen scene in this book has been chosen for the American Illustration 41 archive.
