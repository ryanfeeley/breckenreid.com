## Fresh from the Kiln

We've just unloaded a new firing and the results are promising. The experiment with local clay harvested from the riverbank yielded a rich, terracotta red that works beautifully with the white slip decoration.

### Upcoming Markets
*   **Summer Solstice Market** - June 21st
*   **City Arts Fair** - July 15th-16th

Come say hi and see the new pots in person!
