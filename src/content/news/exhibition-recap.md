## A Wonderful Evening

Thank you to everyone who came out to the opening night of "Earth & Fire". It was incredible to see so many familiar faces and meet new art lovers.

The dialogue between the ceramics and the wooden sculptures by James Doe created a fantastic tension in the gallery space. We are already discussing a follow-up collaboration for next year.
