<p>I am a freelance illustrator with 28 years of experience specializing in visual storytelling and conceptual development. Fascinated by what makes people tick, my practice is defined by an expressive style that shines when applied to first-person perspectives, biography, portraiture, and “hard-to-tell” stories. My aim is to provoke curiosity and create a lasting emotional connection with the viewer.</p>
<p>My work has been celebrated in awards annuals and exhibitions that showcase excellence and innovation in the field, notably earning a <strong>Gold Medal from the Society of Illustrators in New York (SOI)</strong> and inclusion in <strong>Taschen’s <em>100 Illustrators</em></strong>.</p>
<p>As an instructor in Sheridan College’s Illustration BA program, I developed and delivered curriculum focused on conceptual process and media exploration. This passion for knowledge-sharing reaches a global audience through my Domestika course and my work as a dedicated mentor for initiatives such as Koyama Provides. I have served on the Membership Committee for the Society of Illustrators, judged professional competitions at SOI and the Canadian National Magazine Awards, and spent five years as a Program Advisor for the Illustration Diploma at Seneca College. For nearly two decades, I have shaped emerging talent as a portfolio reviewer for Sheridan College and as a visiting artist at institutions including MICA, FIT, and Syracuse University.</p>
<p>Currently, my focus has shifted toward authorship and advocacy. I remain open to assignments from clients while working on my own narrative stories and navigating the complexities of life as an artist in the age of generative AI. I have found immense value in guiding illustrators through consultation and portfolio development, and I continue to support artists individually—helping them protect their craft and strengthen the originality and humanity of their work.</p>
