Fascinated by what makes people tick, my practice is defined by an expressive style that shines when applied to first-person perspectives, biography, portraiture, and “hard-to-tell” stories. My aim is to provoke curiosity and create a lasting emotional connection with the viewer.\n\nMy work has been celebrated in awards annuals and exhibitions that showcase excellence and innovation in the field, notably earning a **Gold Medal from the Society of Illustrators in New York (SOI)** and inclusion in **Taschen’s _100 Illustrators_**.\n\nAs an instructor in Sheridan College’s Illustration BA program, I developed and delivered curriculum focused on conceptual process and media exploration. This passion for knowledge-sharing reaches a global audience through my Domestika course and my work as a dedicated mentor for initiatives such as Koyama Provides. I have served on the Membership Committee for the Society of Illustrators, judged professional competitions at SOI and the Canadian National Magazine Awards, and spent five years as a Program Advisor for the Illustration Diploma at Seneca College. For nearly two decades, I have shaped emerging talent as a portfolio reviewer for Sheridan College and as a visiting artist at institutions including MICA, FIT, and Syracuse University.\n\nCurrently, my focus has shifted toward authorship and advocacy. I remain open to assignments from clients while working on my own narrative stories and navigating the complexities of life as an artist in the age of generative AI. I have found immense value in guiding illustrators through consultation and portfolio development, and I continue to support artists individually—helping them protect their craft and strengthen the originality and humanity of their work.\n\n## Selected Clients\n\nABRAMS · Chronicle Books · Macmillan · Tundra · Penguin Random House Publishing ·  The New York Times · The Boston Globe ·Smithsonian · Nautilus · Scientific American ·  _O_ The Oprah Magazine · Reader’s Digest · UCLA · Colloquy (Harvard) ·  Johns Hopkins and Stanford magazine(s)\n\n## Marian Hebb Research Grant (2025)\n\nRecipient of the **Marian Hebb Research Grant** from the Access Copyright Foundation, supporting the creation of a nonfiction graphic memoir.\n\n## Awards & Exhibitions\n\n- **The Original Art Exhibition**  \n  41st (2021) & 43rd (2023)  \n  Society of Illustrators Museum, New York  \n  *A showcase of illustrations from the year’s best children’s books published in the USA.*\n\n- **Society of Illustrators**  \n  Annuals & Exhibitions: 52, 55 & 60\n\n- **American Illustration**  \n  Annuals & Exhibitions: AI27, AI31, AI36, AI42\n\n## Featured in Books & Annuals\n\n- The Society of Illustrators: 52, 55 & 60  \n- The Society of Illustrators 52 — **Gold Medal**  \n- American Illustration: AI27, AI31, AI36 & AI41  \n- Communication Arts  \n- 3×3 Pro Annual, No. 3  \n- Society of Illustrators West SILA 47  \n- **RESIST!** — A 40-page tabloid newspaper of political comics and graphics by mostly female artists.  \n  Created by Gabe Fowler (Desert Island), edited by Françoise Mouly and Nadja Spiegelman.  \n  Distributed at Women’s Marches across the U.S., January 21, 2017.  \n- *Illustration Now*, Taschen Publishing  \n- *100 Illustrators*, Taschen Publishing\n\n## Judging & Professional Service\n\nMy expertise is recognized within the illustration community, and I have had the honour of serving in the following professional capacities:\n\n- **Portfolio Reviewer**  \n  For 18 years, annually reviewed applicant portfolios for the competitive Illustration BA at Sheridan College; served on the Membership Committee at the Society of Illustrators (New York); and reviewed MFA thesis work at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA).\n\n- **Competition Judge**  \n  Judged professional annual competitions, the Zankel Scholarship, and Student Scholarships at the Society of Illustrators (New York), as well as the Canadian National Magazine Awards.\n\n- **Visiting Artist**  \n  Worked with students at institutions including the Ontario College of Art University (OCADU), the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) NYC, Syracuse University, and the New Hampshire Institute of Art.\n\n- **Program Advisor**  \n  Served on the Illustration Program Advisory Committee at Seneca College, October 2020 – November 2025.","src/content/pages/about.md","3b14be871dcc4351",{"html":56,"metadata":57},"\u003Ch2 id=\"about-julia\">About Julia\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I am a freelance illustrator with 28 years of experience specializing in visual storytelling and conceptual development.
